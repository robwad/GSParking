# GSParking

A Ruby on Rails app I made while working for 2U/GetSmarter during my summer internship after my junior year. The app was designed to solve the parking issues that the company was experiencing after moving to a new location. It implemented a system where the company's 400 employees could offer up their parking spots to other employees when sick or working from home and included a reward system to encourage people to buy into the system.
