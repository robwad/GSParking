# GSParking

This is a Ruby on Rails app I made while working for 2U/GetSmarter during my junior summer. The app was required to solve the parking issues that the company was experiencing after moving to a new location. It implemented a system whereby the company's 400 employees could offer up their parking spots to other employees when sick or working from home and included a voucher reward system to encourage people to buy into the system. The model was implemented with Acive Record and SQLite3.
